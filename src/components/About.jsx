            <p className="text-gray-700">
              One of the most exciting parts of my journey has been participating in hackathons. My recent favorite experience was a 24-hour live hackathon at J.P. Morgan Chase, Mumbai, which was truly life-changing. It showed me how real-world impact begins with a single line of code.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              I'm also passionate about speaking and representation. The journey from being an introvert to confidently expressing myself in front of an audience has been incredible. I love sharing ideas, leading conversations, and using my voice to inspire â€” all while continuing to solve problems with my full stack skills and growing ML knowledge.
